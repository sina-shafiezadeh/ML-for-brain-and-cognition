To detect epileptic seizures, brain signals are processed using a binary classification model and hyperparameter tuning via the Optuna framework.
As a teaching assistant in the "machine learning for brain and cognition" course, I presented this exercise during two lab sessions to master's students in the field of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Padua during the 2022-2023 academic year.
