## Machine Learning for Brain and Cognition Lab
This repository contains an exercise designed to teach master's students in the field of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Padova how to apply standard machine learning models to detect epileptic seizures from brain signals. The exercise uses a binary classification model and hyperparameter tuning via the Optuna framework to process brain signals and detect seizures. As a teaching assistant in the "Machine Learning for Brain and Cognition" course, I presented this exercise during two lab sessions in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 academic years.

Whether you are a psychology student or a researcher in the field of cognitive neuroscience, this repository can be a valuable resource to help you learn about machine learning and its applications in detecting epileptic seizures. You can access the code and materials in this repository to learn how to implement machine-learning algorithms for seizure detection and apply them to your own data.

I hope that you find this repository useful and informative. Please feel free to contribute to this repository by suggesting improvements, adding new code examples, or fixing any issues you find. Thank you for visiting our repository!
